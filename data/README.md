Measurements for the photoelectric effect experiment from FizPrak II at FMF.

Each CSV file contains photocurrent measurements as a function of the stopping potential between the phototube's cathode and anode at a specific photon frequency.
The name of each CSV file gives the photon frequency in nanometers, e.g. `365.csv` contains data for photons with wavelength equal to 365 nanometers (ultraviolet).
